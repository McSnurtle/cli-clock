## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
The program is written in [Python](<https://www.python.org/>), and thus requires it as its sole system-wide dependency.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/McSnurtle/cli-clock \
cd cli-clock \
python -m venv venv \
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade --verbose -r requirements.txt \
```
On windows, you'll have to run `.\venv\Scripts\activate` instead of the above 4th line.
Run with:
`python src/main.py`
